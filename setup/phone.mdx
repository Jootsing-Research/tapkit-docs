Set up your iPhone to work with TapKit by configuring Switch Control.

## Overview

TapKit uses iOS Switch Control to execute gestures on your iPhone. This requires specific configuration to ensure reliable automation.

## Requirements

- iPhone running iOS 16 or later
- USB cable (for initial setup)
- Mac with TapKit app installed
- **Same Wi-Fi network** on both Mac and iPhone
- **Bluetooth enabled** on both devices
- **Same iCloud account** signed in on both devices

<Warning>
Your Mac and iPhone must be on the same Wi-Fi network, have Bluetooth on, and be signed into the same iCloud account. Without these, Switch Control cannot communicate between devices.
</Warning>

## Switch Control Configuration

Navigate to **Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control** on your iPhone.

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Settings > Accessibility path */}

### Switches

You should see 4 switches configured here. These are created automatically when you connect your phone to the TapKit Mac app.

## Menu Items Configuration

<Warning>
Menu Items configuration is critical for automation. The order of items determines how TapKit navigates the Switch Control menu.
</Warning>

When using Switch Control, you scan horizontally, then vertically, and a menu appears. TapKit needs these menu items in a specific order to automate reliably.

First, set **Group Items** to **Off**.

Navigate to each menu category and configure the items in the exact order listed below.

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Menu Items main screen */}

### Top Level

Select and order these items:

1. Gestures
2. Home
3. Device
4. Settings
5. Recipes
6. Shortcuts
7. Element Specific Actions

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Top Level menu items */}

### Gestures

Select and order these items:

1. Saved
2. Tap
3. Flick
4. Pan
5. Pinch
6. Tap and Hold
7. Drag
8. Hold and Drag
9. Direct Touch
10. Double Tap
11. Freehand Fingers

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Gestures menu items */}

### Device

Select and order these items:

1. App Switcher
2. Notification Center
3. Control Center
4. Lock Screen
5. Rotate Screen

## Enabling Switch Control

After configuring all the settings above, Switch Control still needs to be **turned on** for TapKit to work.

<Warning>
There is no off switch inside the Switch Control menu itself. You must toggle it on/off from the main Switch Control screen or use a shortcut.
</Warning>

To enable Switch Control:

1. Go to **Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control**
2. Toggle **Switch Control** to **On** at the top of the screen
3. The gliding cursor should appear on screen

### Using the Action Button (Recommended)

If you're using TapKit on your primary phone, we recommend assigning a shortcut to quickly toggle Switch Control on and off using your iPhone's **Action Button** (iPhone 15 Pro and later).

{/* TODO: Add link to shortcut download and Action Button setup instructions */}

This lets you quickly enable Switch Control when running automations and disable it when using your phone normally.

---

## Verification

After enabling Switch Control, verify everything is working:

1. Switch Control should be toggled **On**
2. You should see the gliding cursor appear on screen
3. The TapKit Mac app should show your phone as connected and ready

## Troubleshooting

### Mac and iPhone can't find each other

Verify:
- Both devices are on the **same Wi-Fi network**
- **Bluetooth is enabled** on both devices
- Both are signed into the **same iCloud account**

<Note>
Public Wi-Fi networks can cause issues. Home and office networks typically work fine, but public Wi-Fi (coffee shops, airports, hotels) may prevent your Mac and iPhone from discovering each other. If you're on a public network and experiencing issues, try switching to a personal hotspot or different network.
</Note>

### Switches not appearing

Make sure your phone is connected via USB and trusted by the Mac. The TapKit Mac app creates the switches automatically.

### Gestures not executing correctly

Verify the Menu Items are in the exact order specified above. TapKit relies on this order to navigate the Switch Control menu.

### Slow automation

Check that Gliding Cursor Speed is set to 30. Lower values will slow down automation.
