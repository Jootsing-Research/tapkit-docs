## Switch Control Configuration

You need to configure Switch Control in your Mac's System Settings. This sets up the keyboard keys that control Switch Control on your iPhone.

Navigate to **System Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control**.

### Setting Up Switches

You'll configure 4 switches (keyboard keys) that map to Switch Control actions. You don't need to understand what these actions do—just set up the key assignments as shown below.

<Note>
These key assignments are currently required. Configurable key bindings are coming soon.
</Note>

| Key | Switch Control Action |
|-----|----------------------|
| **Tab** | Select Item |
| **Escape** | Move to Next Item |
| **Control** | Restart Scanning |
| **System** | Stop Scanning |

### Auto Scanning

Set **Auto Scanning** to **Off**.

That's it for Switch Control configuration on the Mac.

## Connecting to Your iPhone

Once Switch Control is configured, you need to connect your Mac to your iPhone through the Switch Control system menu.

### Opening the Switch Control Menu

You can open the Switch Control menu in two ways:

1. **From TapKit**: Click **Open Menu** in the TapKit Mac app
2. **Manually**: Toggle on Switch Control in System Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control

When the menu opens, you'll see a "Home" switch and a row of buttons:

- Keyboard
- Pointer
- Dock
- Menu Bar
- System
- Custom
- Location
- **Devices**

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Switch Control menu showing the button row */}

### Selecting Your iPhone

Click **Devices** to see Apple devices on your network that are within reach.

Your iPhone will appear in this list. It might be labeled "iPhone" or show your phone's custom name.

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Devices list showing iPhone */}

**How to verify it's the right device:** When you click on your phone in the list, you'll see Switch Control UI appear on your iPhone's screen. That confirms you've selected the correct device.

Click **Connect** to establish the connection.

{/* TODO: Screenshot of Connect button */}

<Note>
We're working on automating this connection process. For now, you'll need to connect manually through the menu. Automatic connection is coming soon.
</Note>

Once connected, Switch Control is active on your iPhone and TapKit can execute gestures.
