description: Home button, app switcher, and system navigation
---

Control fundamental iPhone navigation - returning home, switching apps, and accessing system features.

## Home

Return to the home screen:

```python
phone.home()
```

This is equivalent to pressing the home button or swiping up from the bottom on newer iPhones.

## App Switcher

Open the app switcher to see recent apps:

```python
phone.app_switcher()
```

From the app switcher, you can:
- Swipe between recent apps
- Swipe up to close apps
- Tap an app to switch to it

### Switching Apps Example

```python
# Open app switcher
phone.app_switcher()
time.sleep(0.5)

# Swipe to see previous app
phone.flick(phone.screen.center, direction="right")
time.sleep(0.3)

# Tap to open the app
phone.tap(phone.screen.center)
```

## Control Center

Open Control Center for quick settings:

```python
phone.control_center()
```

Control Center provides access to:
- WiFi, Bluetooth, Airplane mode
- Screen brightness
- Volume controls
- Flashlight, Calculator, Camera
- And more depending on configuration

### Control Center Workflow

```python
# Open Control Center
phone.control_center()
time.sleep(0.5)

# Tap a control (e.g., flashlight in bottom left)
phone.tap((phone.width // 4, phone.height * 3 // 4))
```

## Spotlight Search

Open Spotlight for searching:

```python
phone.spotlight()
```

Spotlight lets you search for:
- Apps
- Contacts
- Messages
- Files
- Web results

### Search for an App

```python
# Open Spotlight
phone.spotlight()
time.sleep(0.3)

# Type search query
phone.type_text("Settings")
time.sleep(0.5)

# Tap first result
phone.tap((phone.width // 2, 200))
```

## Siri

Activate Siri:

```python
phone.siri()
```

<Note>
  Siri activation requires Siri to be enabled on the device. Voice commands aren't directly supported - use this to trigger Siri's listening mode.
</Note>

## Examples

### Clean Return to Home

```python
# Ensure we're on home screen
phone.home()
time.sleep(0.3)

# Go home again to ensure first page
phone.home()
```

### Quick App Switch

```python
# Current app -> App switcher -> Previous app
phone.app_switcher()
time.sleep(0.5)
phone.flick(phone.screen.center, direction="right")
time.sleep(0.3)
phone.tap(phone.screen.center)
```

### Toggle Setting via Control Center

```python
# Toggle Airplane mode
phone.control_center()
time.sleep(0.5)

# Tap Airplane mode icon (top left area)
phone.tap((phone.width // 4, phone.height // 4))
time.sleep(0.3)

# Close Control Center
phone.home()
```
