Control iPhone hardware buttons including volume and the Action button.

## Volume Control

Adjust the device volume:

```python
# Increase volume
phone.volume_up()

# Decrease volume
phone.volume_down()
```

Each call adjusts the volume by one step.

### Adjust by Multiple Steps

```python
# Increase volume by 5 steps
for _ in range(5):
    phone.volume_up()
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Decrease to minimum
for _ in range(16):  # iOS typically has 16 volume steps
    phone.volume_down()
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

## Action Button

Press the Action button (iPhone 15 Pro and later):

```python
phone.action_button()
```

The Action button's behavior depends on user settings - it might:
- Toggle silent mode
- Open the camera
- Start a voice memo
- Run a shortcut
- And more

<Note>
  The Action button is only available on iPhone 15 Pro models and later. Calling this on older devices will have no effect.
</Note>

## Examples

### Mute Before Task

```python
# Lower volume before playing audio
for _ in range(16):
    phone.volume_down()
    time.sleep(0.05)

# Perform task that might play audio
phone.open_app("Music")
```

### Set Specific Volume Level

```python
# First, go to minimum
for _ in range(16):
    phone.volume_down()
    time.sleep(0.05)

# Then set to 50%
for _ in range(8):
    phone.volume_up()
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

### Quick Capture with Action Button

```python
# If Action button is configured for Camera
phone.action_button()
time.sleep(1)

# Take screenshot of camera view
screenshot = phone.screenshot()
```

## Volume Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ringer vs Media volume">
    Volume buttons control different volumes depending on context:
    - When no media is playing: Ringer volume
    - During media playback: Media volume
    - In some apps: App-specific volume
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Silent mode">
    Volume buttons don't affect silent mode. Silent mode is controlled via the ring/silent switch (or Action button if configured).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Volume HUD">
    Each volume press shows the volume HUD briefly. Add a small delay between presses for reliable adjustment.
  </Accordion>
