description: Lock and unlock the device screen
---

Control your iPhone's lock state programmatically.

## Lock

Lock the device screen:

```python
phone.lock()
```

This is equivalent to pressing the side button to turn off the screen.

## Unlock

Unlock the device:

```python
# Unlock (if no passcode)
phone.unlock()

# Unlock with passcode
phone.unlock(passcode="123456")
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `passcode` | `str \| None` | `None` | Device passcode if required |

<Warning>
  If the device has a passcode and you don't provide it, the unlock will fail. Face ID and Touch ID are not supported through the API.
</Warning>

## Check Lock State

Check if the device is locked via the status endpoint:

```python
status = client.status()

if status.screen_locked:
    print("Device is locked")
    phone.unlock(passcode="123456")
else:
    print("Device is unlocked")
```

## Examples

### Safe Unlock

```python
# Check status before unlocking
status = client.status()

if status.screen_locked:
    phone.unlock(passcode="123456")
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait for unlock animation

# Now interact with the device
phone.open_app("Safari")
```

### Lock After Task

```python
# Do some work
phone.open_app("Notes")
time.sleep(1)
phone.type_text("Important note")
time.sleep(0.5)

# Lock when done
phone.lock()
```

### Unlock and Verify

```python
phone.unlock(passcode="123456")
time.sleep(0.5)

# Verify unlocked
status = client.status()
if not status.screen_locked:
    print("Successfully unlocked")
else:
    print("Unlock failed")
```

## Security Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Passcode handling">
    Never hardcode passcodes in your code. Use environment variables or secure credential storage:

    ```python
    import os

    passcode = os.environ.get("DEVICE_PASSCODE")
    phone.unlock(passcode=passcode)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lock timeout">
    Remember that iOS will auto-lock the device after a period of inactivity. For long-running scripts, periodically interact with the device or check lock status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Failed unlock attempts">
    iOS limits incorrect passcode attempts. Be careful with automated unlock attempts to avoid triggering security lockouts.
