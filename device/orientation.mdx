title: Orientation
description: Control device screen orientation
---

Rotate the device screen to different orientations.

## Rotate

Change the device orientation:

```python
# Rotate to landscape (left)
phone.rotate(orientation="left")

# Rotate to landscape (right)
phone.rotate(orientation="right")

# Rotate to portrait
phone.rotate(orientation="portrait")

# Rotate to upside down
phone.rotate(orientation="upside_down")
```

### Orientations

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"portrait"` | Normal upright orientation (default) |
| `"left"` | Landscape with home button on left |
| `"right"` | Landscape with home button on right |
| `"upside_down"` | Portrait but upside down |

## Screen Dimensions

When the device rotates, the effective screen dimensions change:

```python
# In portrait mode
# Width: 1170, Height: 2532 (example)

# After rotating to landscape
phone.rotate(orientation="left")
# The physical pixels don't change, but content is rotated
```

<Note>
  The `phone.width` and `phone.height` properties represent the physical screen dimensions, which don't change with rotation. Your tap coordinates should account for the current orientation.
</Note>

## Examples

### Test Landscape Layout

```python
# Open app and test in landscape
phone.open_app("Safari")
time.sleep(1)

# Rotate to landscape
phone.rotate(orientation="left")
time.sleep(0.5)

# Take screenshot in landscape
screenshot = phone.screenshot()
with open("landscape.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(screenshot)

# Return to portrait
phone.rotate(orientation="portrait")
```

### Test All Orientations

```python
orientations = ["portrait", "left", "right", "upside_down"]

for orientation in orientations:
    phone.rotate(orientation=orientation)
    time.sleep(0.5)

    screenshot = phone.screenshot()
    with open(f"screen_{orientation}.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(screenshot)
```

### Video App Workflow

```python
# Open video app
phone.open_app("YouTube")
time.sleep(2)

# Tap a video
phone.tap(phone.screen.center)
time.sleep(1)

# Rotate to landscape for better viewing
phone.rotate(orientation="left")
time.sleep(0.5)

# Watch video...
time.sleep(5)

# Return to portrait
phone.rotate(orientation="portrait")
```

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wait after rotation">
    The screen takes a moment to rotate. Add a short delay (0.3-0.5s) after rotating before performing other actions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotation lock">
    If rotation doesn't work, the device's rotation lock might be enabled. Check Control Center settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App-specific behavior">
    Some apps lock to specific orientations. The rotate command changes the device orientation, but the app may not respond.
