The `Phone` class represents a connected iPhone and provides methods for controlling it. You access phones through the `TapKitClient`.

## Getting a Phone

### Single Phone

When you have one phone connected, use `get_phone()`:

```python
from tapkit import TapKitClient

client = TapKitClient()
phone = client.get_phone()

print(f"Connected to: {phone.name}")
print(f"Screen: {phone.width}x{phone.height}")
```

<Warning>
  `get_phone()` raises an error if you have zero or multiple phones. Use `list_phones()` or `phone()` for more control.
</Warning>

### Multiple Phones

List all available phones:

```python
phones = client.list_phones()

for phone in phones:
    print(f"{phone.name} ({phone.id})")
    print(f"  Screen: {phone.width}x{phone.height}")
    print(f"  Unique ID: {phone.unique_id}")
```

Get a specific phone by name or ID:

```python
# By name
iphone = client.phone("iPhone 15 Pro")

# By ID
iphone = client.phone("abc123-def456")
```

### Setting a Default Phone

Set a default phone for the client session:

```python
client.use_phone("iPhone 15 Pro")

# Now client-level methods use this phone
client.tap((100, 200))
client.home()
```

## Phone Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `str` | Server-assigned phone ID |
| `name` | `str` | Device name (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro") |
| `unique_id` | `str` | Hardware identifier |
| `width` | `int` | Screen width in pixels |
| `height` | `int` | Screen height in pixels |
| `screen` | `Screen` | Screen object for coordinate utilities |

## Screen Property

Every phone has a `screen` property with helpful coordinate utilities:

```python
phone = client.get_phone()

# Get screen center
center = phone.screen.center
phone.tap(center)

# Check if point is within bounds
point = Point(100, 200)
if phone.screen.contains(point):
    phone.tap(point)

# Clamp coordinates to valid range
clamped = phone.screen.clamp(Point(-10, 3000))
```

See [Geometry](/sdk/geometry) for more screen utilities.

## Executing Actions

The `Phone` object provides methods for all actions:

```python
phone = client.get_phone()

# Touch gestures
phone.tap((100, 200))
phone.double_tap((100, 200))
phone.flick((200, 400), direction="up")

# Device control
phone.home()
phone.lock()
phone.volume_up()

# App control
phone.open_app("Safari")
phone.type_text("Hello world")
```

All action methods return a `Job` object with status information:

```python
job = phone.tap((100, 200))

print(f"Job ID: {job.id}")
print(f"Status: {job.status}")  # pending, running, completed, failed
print(f"Created: {job.created_at}")
```

## Phone Resolution

When calling client methods, the SDK resolves which phone to use:

1. **Explicit phone_id** - If passed to the method
2. **Client default** - Set via `use_phone()`
3. **Auto-select** - If exactly one phone exists
4. **Error** - If ambiguous

```python
# These are equivalent when you have one phone:
phone.tap((100, 200))
client.tap((100, 200))
client.tap((100, 200), phone_id=phone.id)
```
