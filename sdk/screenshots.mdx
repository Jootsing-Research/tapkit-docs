---

TapKit can capture high-resolution screenshots from your connected iPhone. Screenshots are returned as PNG image data.

## Basic Usage

```python
from tapkit import TapKitClient

client = TapKitClient()
phone = client.get_phone()

# Capture screenshot
screenshot = phone.screenshot()

# Save to file
with open("screen.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(screenshot)
```

## Return Value

The `screenshot()` method returns raw PNG bytes:

```python
screenshot = phone.screenshot()

print(type(screenshot))  # <class 'bytes'>
print(len(screenshot))   # Size in bytes
```

## Working with Screenshots

### Save to File

```python
screenshot = phone.screenshot()

with open("screenshot.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(screenshot)
```

### Display with PIL/Pillow

```python
from PIL import Image
import io

screenshot = phone.screenshot()
image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(screenshot))

# Display
image.show()

# Get dimensions
print(f"Size: {image.size}")  # (width, height)
```

### Use with OpenCV

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

screenshot = phone.screenshot()
nparr = np.frombuffer(screenshot, np.uint8)
image = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

# Process with OpenCV
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
```

### Send to Vision API

```python
import base64
import anthropic

screenshot = phone.screenshot()
base64_image = base64.standard_b64encode(screenshot).decode("utf-8")

# Use with Claude
client = anthropic.Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": "image/png",
                        "data": base64_image,
                    },
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What's on this screen?"
                }
            ],
        }
    ],
)
```

## Screenshot Loop

Capture screenshots at intervals:

```python
import time

for i in range(10):
    screenshot = phone.screenshot()
    with open(f"frame_{i:03d}.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(screenshot)
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Client-Level Screenshots

You can also capture via the client directly:

```python
# With explicit phone ID
screenshot = client.screenshot(phone_id="abc123")

# With default phone set
client.use_phone("iPhone 15 Pro")
screenshot = client.screenshot()
```

## Performance Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reduce capture frequency">
    Screenshots require a round-trip to the device. Capture only when needed rather than in a tight loop.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Process asynchronously">
    If doing heavy image processing, consider processing in a separate thread while capturing the next screenshot.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use streaming for real-time">
    For real-time viewing, consider using TapKit's WebRTC streaming instead of repeated screenshots.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Handling

```python
from tapkit import TapKitError

try:
    screenshot = phone.screenshot()
except TapKitError as e:
    print(f"Screenshot failed: {e}")
```

Common errors:
- Phone not connected
- Mac app not running
- Request timeout
