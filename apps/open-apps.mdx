description: Launch applications by name

TapKit can launch any installed app by its display name.

## Basic Usage

Open an app by name:

```python
phone.open_app("Safari")
```

```python
phone.open_app("Settings")
```

```python
phone.open_app("Messages")
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `app_name` | `str` | Display name of the app to open |

## App Names

Use the exact display name as shown on the home screen:

```python
# Built-in apps
phone.open_app("Safari")
phone.open_app("Settings")
phone.open_app("Photos")
phone.open_app("Camera")
phone.open_app("Messages")
phone.open_app("Mail")
phone.open_app("Maps")
phone.open_app("Notes")
phone.open_app("Calendar")
phone.open_app("App Store")
phone.open_app("Music")

# Third-party apps (exact name as displayed)
phone.open_app("Twitter")  # or "X"
phone.open_app("Instagram")
phone.open_app("Slack")
phone.open_app("Chrome")
```

<Tip>
  App names are case-sensitive. Use the exact name as it appears on the device.
</Tip>

## Wait for App to Load

Apps take time to launch. Add appropriate delays:

```python
# Open app
phone.open_app("Safari")

# Wait for app to fully load
time.sleep(1)

# Now interact with the app
phone.tap((phone.width // 2, 100))
```

Different apps have different load times:

```python
# Light apps
phone.open_app("Calculator")
time.sleep(0.3)

# Heavy apps
phone.open_app("Instagram")
time.sleep(2)
```

## Examples

### Open Settings Section

```python
# Open Settings
phone.open_app("Settings")
time.sleep(1)

# Scroll to find option
phone.flick(phone.screen.center, direction="up")
time.sleep(0.3)

# Tap an option (e.g., Wi-Fi)
phone.tap((phone.width // 2, 150))
```

### Browser Automation

```python
# Open Safari
phone.open_app("Safari")
time.sleep(1)

# Tap address bar
phone.tap((phone.width // 2, 80))
time.sleep(0.3)

# Type URL
phone.type_text("example.com")

# Submit (tap Go on keyboard)
phone.tap((phone.width - 50, phone.height - 50))
```

### Switch Between Apps

```python
# Start in Safari
phone.open_app("Safari")
time.sleep(1)

# Do something
phone.tap(phone.screen.center)

# Switch to Notes
phone.open_app("Notes")
time.sleep(1)

# Take note
phone.type_text("Task completed")
```

### Verify App Opened

```python
phone.open_app("Photos")
time.sleep(1)

# Take screenshot to verify
screenshot = phone.screenshot()

# Process screenshot to verify correct app
# (e.g., check for specific UI elements)
```

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="App not found">
    If the app doesn't open, verify:
    - The exact app name (check home screen)
    - The app is installed on the device
    - Case matches exactly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="App already open">
    If the app is already in the foreground, `open_app` will still succeed but may not cause any visible change.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="First-time app launch">
    Some apps show welcome screens or permission dialogs on first launch. Account for these in your automation.
