description: How to authenticate with the TapKit API
---

TapKit uses API keys to authenticate requests. Each API key is associated with your organization and grants access to all phones registered under your account.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Sign in to the [TapKit Dashboard](https://tapkit.ai/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy your key and store it securely

<Warning>
  API keys are sensitive credentials. Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

### With the Python SDK

The SDK looks for your API key in this order:

1. **Explicit parameter** - Passed directly to the client
2. **Environment variable** - `TAPKIT_API_KEY`

```python
from tapkit import TapKitClient

# Option 1: Pass directly
client = TapKitClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Option 2: Use environment variable
import os
os.environ["TAPKIT_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
client = TapKitClient()  # Reads from TAPKIT_API_KEY
```

### With the REST API

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl https://api.tapkit.ai/v1/phones \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

## API Key Format

TapKit API keys follow this format:

```
TK_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Keys always start with `TK_` followed by a random string.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API key in an environment variable rather than hardcoding it:

    ```bash
    export TAPKIT_API_KEY="TK_your_key_here"
    ```

    Your code stays clean and your key stays secure:

    ```python
    client = TapKitClient()  # Automatically reads TAPKIT_API_KEY
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
    Create new API keys periodically and revoke old ones. This limits the impact if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use separate keys for different environments">
    Create separate API keys for development, staging, and production. This makes it easier to revoke access without affecting other environments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Revoking API Keys

If you believe an API key has been compromised:

1. Go to the [TapKit Dashboard](https://tapkit.ai/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Find the compromised key and click **Revoke**
4. Create a new API key and update your applications

Revoked keys are immediately invalidated and cannot be used for any requests.

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_API_KEY",
  "message": "The provided API key is invalid or has been revoked"
}
```

Common causes:
- The API key is incorrect or malformed
- The API key has been revoked
- The `X-API-Key` header is missing
